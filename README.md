# Firebase Initialization Error: Missing or Incorrect Configuration

This repository demonstrates a common Firebase initialization error caused by an incomplete or incorrect Firebase configuration object.  The error messages from Firebase can sometimes be unclear, making debugging difficult. This example shows how to identify and fix this problem.

## Problem

When initializing Firebase with `firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig)`, an error may occur if `firebaseConfig` is missing required fields or contains invalid values.  This often results in cryptic error messages that don't clearly indicate the source of the issue.

## Solution

Carefully review the Firebase configuration object (`firebaseConfig`) to ensure that it includes all the required fields, such as `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `databaseURL`, `projectId`, `storageBucket`, `messagingSenderId`, and `appId`.  Double-check for typos and ensure that the values are correct. 

Also, verify that the configuration object is correctly imported and initialized before calling `firebase.initializeApp()`.  Incorrect imports or assignment can cause unexpected errors.
